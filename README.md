# Potato-Disease-Detection
Developed an intelligent system for detecting potato leaf diseases using machine learning and computer vision
The project involved:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned image datasets of potato leaves affected by various diseases.
Feature Extraction & Model Training: Applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify diseases such as late blight and early blight.
Backend & API Development: Deployed the trained model via Flask APIs for seamless integration with a mobile or web-based application.
Database Management: Stored and managed labeled disease images using MySQL.
Deployment: Hosted the model and API on PythonAnywhere for real-time disease detection.
The system enables farmers and agricultural experts to quickly identify and respond to crop diseases, improving yield and reducing losses.
